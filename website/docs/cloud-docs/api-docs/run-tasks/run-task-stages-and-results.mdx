# Run Task Stages and Results API

-> **Note:** Run Tasks is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team & Governance** upgrade package. Refer to [Terraform Cloud pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.

Run Task Stages and Run Task Results are used within Terraform Cloud to track the execution of [run tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) during a [run][].

This page lists the endpoints you can use to retrieve run task stages and the results from those stages. Refer to the [Run Tasks API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/run-tasks) for endpoints to create and manage run tasks within Terraform Cloud. Refer to the [Run Tasks Integration API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/run-tasks-integration) for endpoints necessary to build custom run tasks for the Terraform Cloud ecosystem.

### Detailed Description

When a [run][] is created, the [associated run tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks#associating-run-tasks-with-a-workspace) in the workspace are read, and a run task stage is created for each unique [stage](/cloud-docs/run/states). Currently only the [Post-Plan Stage](/cloud-docs/run/states#3-the-post-plan-stage) may have tasks, but this may change in the future. Each run task stage then creates a run task result for each task in that stage. For example;

A workspace has two associated tasks called `alpha` and `beta`, and both are in the `post-plan` stage. When a run is created, it will create one run task stage called `post-plan`, and the `post-plan` run task stage will have two run task results; one result for the `alpha` task and the other result for the `beta` task.

## Attributes

### Run Task Stage Status

The run task stage status is found in `data.attributes.status`, and you can reference the following list of possible values.

| Status        | Description                                                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pending`     | The initial status of a run task stage after creation.                           |
| `running`     | The run task stage is executing one or more tasks, which have not yet completed. |
| `passed`      | All of the run task results in the stage passed.                                 |
| `failed`      | One more results in the run task stage failed.                                   |
| `errored`     | The run task stage has errored.                                                  |
| `canceled`    | The run task stage has been canceled.                                            |

### Run Task Result Status

The run task result status is found in `data.attributes.status`, and you can reference the following list of possible values.

| Status        | Description                                                           |
