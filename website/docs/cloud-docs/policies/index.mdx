# Policy Enforcement Overview

-> **Note:** Policy Enforcement is available in the Terraform Cloud [Business tier](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

## Sentinel
> **Hands-on:** Try the [Enforce Policy with Sentinel](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/policy?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorials.

[Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel) is an embedded policy-as-code
framework integrated with the HashiCorp Enterprise products. It enables
fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions, and can be extended to use
information from external sources.

To learn how to use Sentinel and begin writing policies with the Sentinel
language, see [the Sentinel
documentation](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/writing).

You can also use the
[`tfe_sentinel_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/sentinel_policy) resource
from the [Terraform Enterprise provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs) to upload a
policy using Terraform itself.

### Sentinel in Terraform Cloud

~> Sentinel now supports native VCS integration and direct policy set uploads.
See [Managing policies for organizations](/cloud-docs/policies/sentinel/manage-policies) for details
or to read about the [migration utility](/cloud-docs/policies/sentinel/manage-policies#migration-utility).

Using Sentinel with Terraform Cloud involves:

- [Defining the policies](/cloud-docs/policies/sentinel/import) - Policies are defined using the
  [policy language](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/concepts/language) with
  imports for parsing the Terraform plan, state and configuration.
- [Managing policies for organizations](/cloud-docs/policies/sentinel/manage-policies) -
  Users with permission to manage policies can add policies to their organization by configuring VCS
  integration or uploading policy sets through the API. They also define which
  workspaces the policy sets are checked against during runs.
  ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))
- [Enforcing policy checks on runs](/cloud-docs/policies/sentinel/enforce) - Policies are checked when
  a run is performed, after the `terraform plan` but before it can be confirmed
  or the `terraform apply` is executed.
- [Mocking Sentinel Terraform data](/cloud-docs/policies/sentinel/mock) - Terraform Cloud provides the
  ability to generate mock data for any run within a workspace. This data can be
  used with the [Sentinel CLI](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/commands) to
  test policies before deployment.

#### Standard Imports

The Terraform integration for HashiCorp Sentinel implements all of the
available [standard imports](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports).

## OPA

The [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) is an open-source, general-purpose policy engine.
OPA has a high-level declarative language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) which, much like Sentinel,
is used to enforce controls using a policy as code approach. Terraform compliance
checks offload policy evaluation and authorization decisions to the OPA policy
engine by calling well-defined APIs.

By adding support for OPA policy checks into the existing policy check workflow, we are able to provide
customers with multiple language options for enforcing policy.

### OPA in Terraform Cloud

~> OPA supports direct policy set uploads as well as VCS integration.
See [Managing policies for organizations](/cloud-docs/policies/sentinel/manage-policies) for details

Using OPA with Terraform Cloud involves:

- [Policy Guidelines](/cloud-docs/policies/opa/opa-policy-guidelines) - Policies are defined using the
[rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) with a certain set of guidelines.
- [Managing policies for organizations](/cloud-docs/policies/opa/manage-policies) -
Users with permission to manage policies can add policies to their organization by configuring VCS
integration or uploading policy sets through the UI or the API. They also define which
workspaces the policy sets are checked against during runs.
([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))
- [Enforcing policy checks on runs](/cloud-docs/policies/opa/enforce) - Policies are checked when
a run is performed, after the `terraform plan` but before it can be confirmed
or the `terraform apply` is executed.
