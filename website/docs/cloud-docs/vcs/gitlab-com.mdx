# Configuring GitLab.com Access

These instructions are for using GitLab.com for Terraform Cloud's VCS features. [GitLab CE and GitLab EE have separate instructions,](/cloud-docs/vcs/gitlab-eece) as do the [other supported VCS providers.](/cloud-docs/vcs)

Configuring a new VCS provider requires permission to manage VCS settings for the organization. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

Connecting Terraform Cloud to your VCS involves four steps:

| On your VCS                                                                    | On Terraform Cloud                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                                                                | Create a new connection in Terraform Cloud. Get redirect URI.               |
| Register your Terraform Cloud organization as a new app. Provide redirect URI. |                                                                             |
|                                                                                | Provide Terraform Cloud with application ID and secret. Request VCS access. |
| Approve access request.                                                        |                                                                             |

The rest of this page explains the GitLab.com versions of these steps.

-> **Note:** Alternately, you can skip the OAuth configuration process and authenticate with a personal access token. This method requires using Terraform Cloud's API. For details, see [the OAuth Clients API page](/cloud-docs/api-docs/oauth-clients).

## Adding a New VCS Provider on Terraform Cloud

1. Open Terraform Cloud in your browser and navigate to **Settings > Version Control > Providers** for your organization.

1. Click **Add VCS Provider**. If you just created your organization, you might already be on this page. Otherwise:

   1. Make sure the bottom-left organization menu currently shows your organization.
   1. Click the **Settings** link at the top of the page (or within the ☰ menu).
   1. On the next page, click **Providers** under **Version Control** in the left sidebar.
   1. Click **Add a VCS Provider**.

1. Select **GitHub.com** from the **Github** dropdown.

1. Locate the **Redirect URI** and copy it to your clipboard.

Leave the page open in a browser tab for future use.

## Creating a New Application on GitLab

1. In a new browser tab, open [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) and log in as whichever account you want Terraform Cloud to act as. For most organizations, this account should be a dedicated service user, but a personal account also works.

   ~> **Important:** The account you use for connecting Terraform Cloud must have admin (master) access to any shared repositories of Terraform configurations because creating webhooks requires admin permissions.

1. Navigate to GitLab's [User Settings > Applications](https://gitlab.com/profile/applications) page.

   You can reach this page at <https://gitlab.com/profile/applications>. You can also reach it through GitLab's menus:

   - In the upper right corner, click your profile picture and choose **Settings**.
   - In the navigation sidebar, click **Applications**.

1. Fill out the fields and checkboxes with the corresponding values currently displayed in your Terraform Cloud browser tab. Terraform Cloud lists the values in the order they appear and includes controls for copying values to your clipboard.

   Fill out the form as follows:

   | Field                   | Value                                                                                            |
   | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Name                    | Terraform Cloud (`<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME>`)                                                     |
   | Redirect URI            | `https://app.terraform.io/<YOUR CALLBACK URL>`, the redirect URI you copied from Terraform Cloud |
   | Confidential (checkbox) | ✔️ (enabled)                                                                                     |
   | Expire access tokens (checkbox) | ✘ (disabled)                                                                             |
   | Scopes (all checkboxes) | api                                                                                              |

   -> **Note:**    -> **Note:** Terraform Cloud refreshes tokens if they are older than 6 hours, but GitLab marks OAuth tokens as expired 2 hours after they are issued. Disabling the `Expire access tokens` checkbox prevents Terraform Cloud from attempting to use expired tokens. 

1. Click **Save application**, which creates the application and takes you to its page.

1. Leave this page open in a browser tab. You need the unique **Application ID** and **Secret** for future use.

## Setting up Your Provider on Terraform Cloud

1. On the **Configure settings** tab, enter the **Application ID** and **Secret**, as well as an option **Name** for this VCS connection.

1. Click **Connect and continue** to go to a page on GitLab.com, asking whether you want to authorize the app.

1. Click **Authorize** at the bottom of the authorization page.

## Setting Up SSH Keypair on Terraform Cloud (Optional)

Most organizations do not need to add an SSH private key. However, if the organization repositories include Git submodules that are only accessible using SSH, you can add an SSH key along with the OAuth credentials. You can add or update the SSH private key at a later time.

### Important Notes

- You onlt use SSH to clone Git submodules. All other Git operations still use HTTPS.
- Do not use your personal SSH key to connect Terraform Cloud and GitLab. Generate a new one or use an existing key reserved for service access.
- In upcoming steps, you must provide Terraform Cloud with the private key. Although Terraform Cloud does not display the text of the key to users after you enter, Terraform Cloud retains the key and uses it for authenticating to GitLab.
- Protect this private key carefully. It can push code to the repositories you use to manage your infrastructure. Follow your organization's policies for protecting important credentials.

### If You Do Not Need an SSH Keypair:

1. Click **Skip and Finish** to return to Terraform Cloud's **VCS Providers** page, which now includes your new GitLab client.

### If You Do Need an SSH Keypair:

1. On a secure workstation, create an SSH keypair that Terraform Cloud can use to connect to GitLab.com. The exact command depends on your OS, but is usually something like `ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f "/Users/<NAME>/.ssh/service_terraform" -C "service_terraform_enterprise"`
   
   This action creates a `service_terraform` file with the private key and a `service_terraform.pub` file with the public key. This SSH key must have an empty passphrase. Terraform Cloud cannot use SSH keys that require a passphrase.

1. While logged into the GitLab.com account you want Terraform Cloud to act as, navigate to the **SSH Keys settings** page.

1. Add a new SSH key and paste the value of the SSH public key you just created.

1. On Terraform Cloud's **Add VCS Provider** page, paste the text of the **SSH private key** you just created.

1. Click **Add SSH Key** to return to Terraform Cloud's **VCS Provider** page, which now includes your new GitLab client.

You successfully configured GitHub access for Terraform Cloud. You can create Terraform workspaces based on your organization's repositories.
